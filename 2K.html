    <h1>Work at 2K Games</h1>
    <div class="project">
      <p>As Associate Project Manager I oversee the coordination, review, and delivery of assets across multiple global territories. I work with internal & external  stakeholders and First Party vendors to ensure high-quality assets are delivered on time and aligned with brand standards. I manage packaging schedules, facilitate approvals, and support the product lifecycle from concept to launch.</p>

      <h2>PGA TOUR 2K25</h2>
      <p>I worked on the packaging for PGA TOUR 2K25, contributing to the development and coordination of multiple key assets including coversheets, disc labels, pre-order inserts, point of sale materials, and online manuals. My primary focus was on EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) assets, where I helped ensure all regional requirements were met in terms of localization, legal compliance, and formatting standards. This involved close collaboration with cross-functional teams, including localization, legal, and print production, to maintain accuracy and consistency across all deliverables for the region.</p>

      <h2>WWE 2K25</h2>
      <p>I supported the packaging development for WWE 2K25, working across a wide range of assets including coversheets, disc labels, pre-order inserts, point of sale materials, and online manuals. My responsibilities were primarily focused on the EMEA region, ensuring all materials were properly localized and met regional legal and compliance standards. I collaborated closely with internal teams and external partners to manage asset updates, track approvals, and ensure timely delivery of all packaging components ahead of key milestones and release dates.</p>

      <h2>Sid Meier's Civilization® VII – Nintendo Switch 2</h2>
      <p>I worked on the packaging for Civilization VII for the Nintendo Switch 2 edition, supporting all regions including America, EMEA, and parts of Asia. This project was unique in that it involved a platform that had not yet been released, requiring close coordination with both Nintendo and the development team to ensure all packaging assets—such as coversheets and Cart labels—met evolving platform guidelines and specifications. Working across multiple regions also meant managing varying compliance requirements and localisation needs, all while adapting to the challenges of developing for an unreleased console.</p>

      <h2>WWE 2K25 – Nintendo Switch 2</h2>
      <p>My next project was developing the packaging for WWE 2K25 for Nintendo Switch 2, which covered America and EMEA regions but did not include any Asia SKUs. This title featured a pre-order bonus, it was one of the first projects to incorporate the new DLC voucher template for the Nintendo Switch 2, This requiring close attention to ensure it complied with Nintendo’s latest guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Mafia: The Old Country</h2>
      <p>I worked on was Mafia: The Old Country, which involved managing multiple packaging assets including coversheets, disc labels, pre-order inserts, point of sale materials, and online manuals. I was responsible for coordinating packaging across the US, EMEA, and Asia regions ensuring that each market’s requirements were met. The online manuals for this project required particularly close collaboration with the development team through detailed meetings, to guarantee all gameplay information and instructions were accurate and clearly presented.</p>

      <h2>NBA 2K26</h2>
      <p>I worked on the packaging for NBA 2K26, managing multiple assets including coversheets, disc labels, pre-order inserts, point of sale materials, and online manuals. Due to the title releasing across numerous platforms, combined with the concurrent launch of Borderlands 4, this project was particularly demanding and required careful coordination and time management to ensure all assets were delivered accurately and on schedule across all regions and formats.</p>

      <h2>Borderlands 4</h2>
      <p>The next project I worked on was Borderlands 4, which, although releasing on only two platforms internally, involved multiple editions—Standard, Deluxe, and Super Deluxe—adding significant complexity to the packaging process. The project required creating new coversheet artwork for certain Asia SKUs and producing a large volume of assets, including coversheets, disc labels, pre-order inserts, and point of sale materials for each edition. This project was particularly challenging as I was simultaneously managing packaging responsibilities for NBA 2K26, requiring careful prioritisation and coordination to ensure all deliverables were completed accurately and on schedule.</p>
