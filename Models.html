        <h3>SteamPunk Town</h3>
        <p>The aim of this project is to create a 3D environment for that can help demonstrate new features and techniques for game asset creation for use in the client’s lectures. The environment that will be created is Victorian era steam punk environment inspired by games such as Dishonoured and Bioshock Infinite.</p>
          <p> The features and techniques used in the project are the following:</p>
        
            <p>•PBR Materials</p>
            <p>• Assets with dynamic properties (E.g. cloth)</p>
            <p>• Good instancing (displaying the same object multiple times)</p>
            <p>• Modular Assets</p>
            <p>• Implemented Different Light Sources ( via Unreal Engine Blueprints)</p>
            <p>• Destructible Object</p>
            <p>• Photogrammetry</p>
            <p>• PBR Materials Creation</p>
            <p>• Decals</p>

        <h3>Japanese Shrine</h3>
        <p>The idea for this project is a small Japanese shrine running in UE4. The main reason for choosing this idea is it will help me improve and demonstrate my skills of environmental modelling. The environment is all PBR with some materials made in Substance Designer as well as the Rocks being made via Photogrammetry.</p>

              <p class="description">
                This Animation running in unreal engine tells the story of a skeleton losing money at a casino. This is a environment & character animation I had to make for my second year project. The animation for the skeleton character was captured in a MoCap studio and the environment. </p>

                  <p class="description">
                    The famous time travelling car from Back to the Future was my first year project for University. I tried to add all the props of from the movie onto the car and animated certain parts of the car. This model was one of the first models I made at University. </p>

        <h3>SwordFish II</h3>
        <p>A Model of Spike Spiegel’s Swordfish II from the anime series “Cowboy Bebop”. This Model was made as challenge for me to see if I could make a PBR Textured Asset for UE4 within a a day.</p>

      <h3>CRT TV</h3>
      <p>CRT (or cathode-ray tube) used to be standard way to play thoses Gaming Classic in the 80’s This Model is very simple but is is put together with PBR materials, The Object was original made for my placement year project but was purposed with this PBR material as the original texture was made for a cel-shaded game.</p>
