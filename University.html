          <h2>University of Portsmouth - Computer Games Enterprise</h2>
        </div>
        <h3>Grade: First-class Honours , GPA 3.59</h3>
        <p class="description">
            During my time at the University of Portsmouth, I developed a well-rounded understanding of the games industry with a strong emphasis on business, project management, and entrepreneurship, supported by technical and creative skill-building. The course focused on preparing students for leadership roles within game development, combining practical production experience with deep theoretical knowledge.</p>
            <h3>Final Year</h3>
            <p class="description">
            In my final year, I delivered a substantial individual project in 3D art and contributed to a group project that simulated a real-world production environment. These experiences solidified my ability to balance creativity with structure, take ownership of deliverables, and ensure quality and consistency across a project’s lifecycle </p>

                This is a Steampunk Town that is being created for a client to demonstrate different types of 3D art techniques, Such as PBR Materials, VFX, Cloth Physics, lighting. </p> 
                
                <h4>Japanese Shrine - 3rd Year Project</h4>
                <div class="video-container">

                  </div>
                  <p class="description">
                    The idea for this project is a small Japanese shrine running in UE4. The main reason for choosing this idea is it will help me improve and demonstrate my skills of environmental modelling. The environment is all PBR with some materials made in Substance Designer as well as the Rocks being made via Photogrammetry. </p> 
                
                    <h3>Second Year</h3>
            <p class="description">
            As I progressed, I focused on leadership, planning, and commercial awareness. I led and collaborated on group projects where we ran a student-led game business, managing schedules, budgets, and team dynamics. I deepened my expertise in 3D modelling, asset pipelines, and visual design while continuing to enhance my ability to communicate between creative and technical teams.</p>

              <p class="description">
                This Animation running in unreal engine tells the story of a skeleton losing money at a casino. This is a environment & character animation I had to make for my second year project. The animation for the skeleton character was captured in a MoCap studio and the environment. </p> 
              
            <h3>First Year</h3>
            <p class="description">
            In my early studies, I developed technical skills in 2D and 3D art using industry-standard tools like Adobe Photoshop and 3D Studio Max, alongside foundational knowledge of C++ programming and cross-disciplinary collaboration. I worked on team-based game projects that required clear communication, problem-solving, and project scoping—skills essential for production roles.</p>

                The famous time travelling car from Back to the Future was my first year project for University. I tried to add all the props of from the movie onto the car and animated certain parts of the car. This model was one of the first models I made at University. </p>
